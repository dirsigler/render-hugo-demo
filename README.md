# Static Site example with Hugo on Render

This repository contains a simple static site generated via [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed on [Render.com](http://render.com/).

It uses the [Minimal](https://github.com/calintat/minimal) Theme with some simple tweaks to be in harmony with the Render.com style.
